Installing Phoenix (WPS web client)
==========================

This installation works on Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 14.04, Centos 6, ...). It might still work on MacOSX but packages are updated only from time to time. Most of the dependencies come from `Anaconda <http://www.continuum.io/>`_ Python distribution system. Additional conda packages come from the `Binstar channel Birdhouse <https://binstar.org/birdhouse>`_. The installation is done with `Buildout <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/2.3.1>`_.

Please check the `Readme <https://github.com/bird-house/pyramid-phoenix/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for installation instructions.
